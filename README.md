# RansomWare
Hello My Friends !
The ransomware I made today locks the victim's device and does not allow the device to be opened until you tell it the password. This ransomware is a little more advanced and does not allow the device to be shut down or restarted, so the victim cannot exit the software in any way. I am leaving the screenshot below. ransomware.png
Password App "147627"
